# Inspiration
Everything started when we were playing a game that required an internet connection to play together, but some of us had difficulties with it. After analyzing the problem, we got to the conclusion that a co-op game, where an internet connection isn't required will promote communication between players.
# What it does
Our game besides that doesn't require an internet connection to play it co-op, promotes communication between the peers as you need to put together the information from your screen with the one from your partner. The puzzle that we chose (besides that is interesting and will keep you at home, which is a good thing in this period) creates awareness about the importance of taking the right protocols to protect against pandemics.
# Accomplishments that we're proud of
Most of the mechanics of our game are already done. We have already written a big part of our storyline. The game is dynamic enough to be easy and fast to create new levels, therefore we will make a workshop feature in the nearest future for the community to create their own adventurous puzzles.
